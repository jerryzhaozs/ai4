# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      #- uses: actions/checkout@v2

      #- name: Use Node.js 
      #  uses: actions/setup-node@v1
        
      #- name: Install dependencies  # 第二步，安装依赖
      #  run: npm install
        
      #- name: Build              # 第三步，打包代码
      #  run: npm run docs:build
      - name: deploy server   # 第五步，重启服务
        uses: appleboy/ssh-action@master

          username: ${{ secrets.SSH_USERNAME }}
          key: ${{ secrets.ACCESS_TOKEN }}
          # 重启的脚本，根据自身情况做相应改动，一般要做的是migrate数据库以及重启服务器
